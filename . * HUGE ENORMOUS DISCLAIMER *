*** THIS FORK OF VANITYGEN IS *NOT* TO BE TRUSTED ***
 - EXPECT ERRORS
 - VERIFY ANY AND ALL OUTPUT FROM THIS PROGRAM THAT ISN'T IMMEDIATELY DISCARDED

The purpose of this fork is to produce a new version of vanitygen that supports Zcash address generation.  

As of the 13th November 2016, only the bare minimum amount of testing has been done.  

Your feedback here or via https://forum.z.cash/users/voluntary would be appreciated.
