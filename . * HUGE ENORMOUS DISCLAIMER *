 *** THIS FORK OF VANITYGEN IS *NOT* TO BE TRUSTED ***
 - EXPECT ERRORS
 - VERIFY ANY AND ALL OUTPUT FROM THIS PROGRAM THAT ISN'T IMMEDIATELY DISCARDED
 
 The purpose of this fork is to produce a new version of vanitygen that supports Zcash address generation.  
 
 Due to remaining bitcoin specific program logic, Zcash address generation is limited to when the program is initiated such as this: 
 
  > ./vanitygen -r abc
